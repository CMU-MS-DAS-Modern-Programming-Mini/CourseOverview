						<h2>The Goals of the Course</h2>
						<ul class="r-fit-text">
							<li>Be able to, given a task in data analytics, be able to pick the right algorithm and apply Python tools to solve the task.
							<li>Gain insight into the process of how Python and Python-based tools work and can be applied properly for data analytics.
							<li>Be able to apply the techniques learned in the class to be able to manipulate, process, and manage data sets from small and simple to large and complex.
							<li>Be able to present their software and develop effective software packages in Python within a team development environment.
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2> Topics we will try to cover: </h2>
						<ul class="r-fit-text">
							<li>Brief introduction to Python3 and the development ecosystem
							<li>Introduction to object-oriented and procedural programming models and basic software architecture principles
							<li>Professional programming techniques for modern software development: version control and team development (Git and GitHub), coding standards, unit and regression testing (PyTest) and continuous integration (TravisCI)
							<li>Introduction to R and RStudio
							<li>Developing reusable, sharable, and interactive electronic notebooks with Jupyter
							<li>Python environment management: Virtualenv and Anaconda
							<li>Fundamentals of data structures and their implementation in Python
							<li>Python packages for science and data science: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, StatsModels
							<li>Data processing techniques for small, medium and large datasets
							<li>Manual and programmatic metadata standards
							<li>Data Analytics with Python: Optimization, Linear and Non-Linear Regression, Mathematical Modeling, Monte Carlo Sampling, Distributions, and Clustering
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2> Assignments and Grading </h2>
						<p class="r-fit-text">There will be 3 programming assignnemts throughout the mini semester and a final project</p>
						<ul class="r-fit-text">
							<li>Each programming assignment will be 20% of grade
								<ul>
									<li> All assighments will be submitted through GitHub, specific instructions will be given with the assignment
									<li> All assignments will be due 7 days after the assignment is given, 3% points will be deducted every day that the assignment is template
								</ul>
							<li>Final Project will be 40% of the grade
								<ul>
									<li> The final project will include a code walkthrough in-class presentation </li>
								</ul>
							</ul>		 â€ƒ

					<h2> How will we interact? </h2>
					We will attempt to do as much interaction in the class through GitHub
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>GitHub is is a web-platform that:</h3>
						<ul>
						 <li>Provides software developers a place to interact
						 <li>Provides a place to share version contolled code
						 <li>Provides a place to manage software release and distribution
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Getting a GitHub account (if you don't already have a GitHub account):</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Go to <a href="github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a>
							<li>Click "Sign Up" at the top right
							<li>Go through the process
							<li>Send your GitHub user name to <a href="mailto:stbrown@andrew.cmu.edu">stbrown@andrew.cmu.edu</a>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> GitHub Organization </h3>
						<p>
							Created an Organization on Github called:
							<a href="https://github.com/CMU-MS-DAS-Modern-Programming-Mini" target="_blank">
									CMU-MS-DAS-Modern-Programming-Mini
							</a>
						</p>
						<p>
						The organization allows us to group all of the materials and work done for the class
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> GitHub Team </h3>
						<p>
							We can add teams to the GitHub Organization that allows us to control groups of developers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Can see our current teams at
							<a href="https://github.com/orgs/CMU-MS-DAS-Modern-Programming-Mini/teams" target="_blank">
								https://github.com/orgs/CMU-MS-DAS-Modern-Programming-Mini/teams
							</a>
						<p>
						We currently have a team called "Class-2021"", which I will make all of you a member once you send me your github account.
						</p>

						<h2> General Help with the course</h2>
						<p> Once you are in our GitHub organziation, you will gain access so the Syllabus repository</p>
						<p> You can ask questions throug the
							<a href = "https://github.com/CMU-MS-DAS-Modern-Programming-Mini/Syllabus/issues" target="_blank">

						<h3> Software Development Cycles </h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Requirements gathering
							<li> Functional Specification
							<li> Initial Development Phase
							<li> Release Cycle
									<ul>
										<li> Testing
										<li> Addressing Issues
										<li> Release Software
										<li> Repeat
									</ul>
								</li>

							<h3> A few things to keep in mind when developing software </h3>
							<ul class="r-fit-text">
								<li> Elegant is the enemy of good
								<li> Testing, testing, testing, testing...
								<li> Performance is the second step, not the first
								<li> Planning is a good thing
								<li> Pick the right tool for the job
								<li> Don't be afraid to use other people's work
								<li> Invest early in version control (Git)
								<li> Just because you are doing scientific software development,
									   doesn't mean you get to make crappy code
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3> A few things to think about when developing as a team </h3>
							<ul class="r-fit-text">
								<li> Establish rules for group development based on best practices
									<ul>
										<li> Code reviews
										<li> Testing procedures (automated testing)
										<li> Coding standards (that are enforced)
										<li> Documentation requirements
									</ul>
								<li> Spend time up front on setting up the collaborative environment
								<li> Spend time creating a contribution plan and software philosophy
								<li> Adopt a software development project management (Scrum, Agile, DevOps)
							</ul>
